#CALCULATOR APP
----------------
This is a personal project that was inspired by a practice project that I found. It is a pretty basic calculator website made with native HTML, CSS, and JS. This is my first project importing/exporting code blogs from and to different files. I also don't tend to use object driven js too often, so it fun to challenge myself with this. I am proud of how it turned out, but as always, I am always welcome to some feedback.

Thanks heaps!!
